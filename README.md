# HW_6_WeatherDash
Creating a weather dashboard with current and future forecast. Displaying properties such as, temperature in Fahrenheit, UV Index, Wind, and more.

## Framework Used
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery

## Installation

1. I started the project by pseudo coding. I outlined what properties needed to be shown on the weather dashboard. How I wanted it to look and the ability to ask users if they want to share their location.

2. I created the HTML. It includes the header, the title of the site and the container divs where the search bar appers and the weather information.

3. I created the CSS where I styled the page backround, added color to the fonts. Placed the containers on the center of the body of the page.

4. I used jQuery to power the weather dashboard.

5. Used ajax to call the api from the Openweathermap.org to gather the weather data from. 

6. The data type used was "GET" and made sure to read the API documentation as some of them use "POST". 

7. Entered an image tag where the forecast icons would be shown on the 5 day forecast.

8. Lastly created a function where I assigned attributes to currentCity and fiveDayFor.
